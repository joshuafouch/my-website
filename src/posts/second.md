| Victimae paschali laudes immolent Christiani.                                                   | Christians, to the Paschal Victim offer your thankful praises.                                                                 |
| Agnus redemit oves: Christus innocens Patri reconciliavit peccatores.                           | A Lamb the sheep redeemeth: Christ, who only is sinless, reconciles sinners to the Father.                                     |
| Mors et vita duello conflixere mirando: dux vitae mortuus, regnat vivus.                        | Death and life have contended in that combat stupendous: the Prince of Life, who died, reigns immortal.                        |
| Dic nobis Maria, quid vidisti in via?                                                           | Speak, Mary, declaring what you saw wayfaring.                                                                                 |
| Sepulcrum Christi viventis, et gloriam vidi resurgentis: Angelicos testes, sudarium, et vestes. | “The tomb of Christ, who is living, the glory of Jesus' resurrection; bright angels attesting, the shroud and napkin resting.” |
| Surrexit Christus spes mea: praecedet vos in Galilaeam.                                         | “Yes, Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee he goes before you.”                                                                |
| Scimus Christum surrexisse a mortuis vere: Tu nobis, victor Rex, miserere.                      | Christ indeed from death is risen, our new life obtaining. Have mercy, victor King, ever reigning.                             |
| Amen. Alleluia.                                                                                 | Amen. Alleluia.                                                                                                                |

# Paschal Stichera

_Byzantine Paschal Vigil_

> **Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered!** (Ps. 67:2)  
> Today, a sacred Pascha is revealed to us,  
> a new and holy Pascha, a mystical Pascha,  
> a Pascha worthy of veneration,  
> a Pascha that is Christ the Redeemer;  
> a blameless Pascha, a great Pascha;  
> a Pascha of the faithful;  
> a Pascha that hath opened to us the gates of Paradise;  
> a Pascha that sanctifies the faithful!

> **As smoke vanishes, so let them vanish!** (Ps. 67:3)  
> Come from the vision, O ye women, bearers of good tidings,  
> and say ye to Sion:  
> Receive from us the good tidings of the Resurrection of Christ;  
> adorn thyself, exult, and rejoice, O Jerusalem,  
> for thou hast seen Christ the King come forth  
> from the tomb like a bridegroom in procession.

> **So let sinners perish at the presence of God,  
> and let the righteous be glad!** (Ps. 67:3–4)  
> The myrrh-bearing women in the deep dawn  
> stood before the tomb of the Giver of Life;  
> they found an angel sitting upon the stone, and he said:  
> _Why seek ye the living among the dead?  
> Why mourn ye the incorruptible amid corruption?  
> Go, proclaim unto His disciples._

> **This is the day which the Lord hath made;  
> let us rejoice and be glad therein!** (Ps. 117:24)  
> Pascha the beautiful, Pascha, the Lord's Pascha,  
> the Pascha all-venerable hath dawned upon us.  
> Pascha, with joy let us embrace one another.  
> O Pascha! Ransom from sorrow,  
> for from the tomb today, as from a bridal chamber,  
> hath Christ shone forth,  
> and hath filled the women with joy, saying:  
> _Proclaim unto the apostles._

**Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.  
Both now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.**

> It is the day of Resurrection, let us be radiant for the feast,  
> and let us embrace one another.  
> Let us say: Brethren, even to them that hate us,  
> let us forgive all things on the Resurrection,  
> and thus let us cry out:  
> **Christ is risen from the dead,  
> trampling down death by death,  
> and on those in the tombs bestowing life!** (×3)
